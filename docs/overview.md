# Overview

Jelly is a simple framework for building web applications in PureScript.

## Features

- **Reactive**

  State management can be done using a reactive value called a `Signal`. It is not FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) because it is basically a discrete value.

- **No Virtual DOM**
  Jelly does not use a virtual DOM. It updates the DOM directly.
- **Declarative**
  With Jelly, components are defined declaratively, but it is also possible to control when components are mounted and unmounted.
- **Hooks**
  Logic can be reused and synthesized using Hooks.
- **Component**
  A simple component system can be used to divide pages by role.
- **SPA Routing**
  The router overrides the browser's behavior, allowing page transitions without loading the entire page.
- **SSG**
  Jelly can be used to generate static HTML files, and hydrate them to make them interactive.
